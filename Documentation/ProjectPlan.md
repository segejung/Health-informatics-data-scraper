# Project Plan

**Author**: HZ-TASK Force

## 1 Introduction

Project assigned to HZ-TASK Force is Data Scrapper. 
Many public health entities utiize various formats such as PDFs, Websites, Excel, etc for data handling. This causes a lot of inefficiencies and complexity. The goal of this project is to build a tool that will enable easier data hangling for researchers and develepors. PDF, HTML, Form, and API data will output to CSV. 

## 2 Process Description

The project process is composed of 8 team sprints. The following is each process description. 
------------------
- Activity name: *Project Kick-off (TS#1)*
- Activity description: *Project is kicked-off in this activity. Team is formed and top 10 project list is chosen by the team. The class TAs assign teams a project they will be working on. Once the team and project is decided, project mentor and stakeholders are introduced. Project is introduced briefly by the mentor and a broad idea of what the team will be working on.*
- Entrance criteria: *For this activity, team needs to be formed and project assigned. Also need a project mentor assigned to the team as well.*
- Exit criteria: *To accomplish this activity done, team is formed and project is assigned.*
------------------
- Activity name: *Requirement/Research (TS#2)*
- Activity description: *This activity is the requirement and research phase. The goal is to research about the assigned project. Research use cases, markets, competition, and so on. Study the tool's functionality and limits. The second part is to create more definition to the project scope and requirements. What is the team trying to accomplish for this project? What is the final deliverable? What are we not doing?*
- Entrance criteria: *Need input from GTRI, Tia, Ellie, and Nate on the requirements.*
- Exit criteria: *Clear list of objectives and deliverables laid out. Requirements are finalized and aligned with the stakeholders*
------------------
- Activity name: *Design (TS#3)*
- Activity description: *This activity is Draft a high level architecture diagram of the tool. This will include what tools and languages the team will use.*
- Entrance criteria: *Requirements and the functionality of the tool should be known.*
- Exit criteria: *Functionalities, tools, and language chosen.*
------------------
- Activity name: *CI/CD Pipeline*
- Activity description: *Deployment pipeline for the tool needs to be figured out so that we know how to collaborate with docker and developers.*
- Entrance criteria: **
- Exit criteria: *Decide the tools the team will use for deployment.*
------------------
- Activity name: *Wireframe Mockup*
- Activity description: *Draft initial wireframe for the front user interface.*
- Entrance criteria: *Work with the architecture diagram to know the functionalities that needs to be on the UI.*
- Exit criteria: *Initial wireframe mockedup using Basiliq.*
------------------
- Activity name: *Documentation*
- Activity description: *Documentation is important to track research and for alignment between developers and the stakeholders.*
- Entrance criteria: *Align with stakeholders to know which documentation is needed.*
- Exit criteria: *Documentation folder created in GitHub.*
------------------
*Environment Setup*
- Activity name: *Environment setup for Development*
- Activity description: *Hello World set up using Flask web framework and deployed using Docker.*
- Entrance criteria: *Refer to the architecture diagram to launch our Hello World app.*
- Exit criteria: *App is deployed through the pipeline.*
------------------
- Activity name: *Finalize/align project with mentor*
- Activity description: *Meet with the project mentors and stakeholders to get a confirmation on the direction of the teams' effort. Discuss key functionalities and sample data.*
- Entrance criteria: *Prepare with questions to ask the stakeholders.*
- Exit criteria: *Everyone aligned and know what to work on.*
------------------
- Activity name: *API research*
- Activity description: *One of the four input types is API. Initial research on how to use API to CSV.*
- Entrance criteria: *Need to gather sample API data.*
- Exit criteria: *Documentation of research*
------------------
- Activity name: *Python PDF Library*
- Activity description: *Initial research on finding how to parse PDF input types. Find existing libraries the team can use.*
- Entrance criteria: **
- Exit criteria: *Documentation of research*
------------------
- Activity name: *Form/HTML parser*
- Activity description: *Initial research on how to parse Form/HTML input.*
- Entrance criteria: **
- Exit criteria: *Documentation of research*
------------------
- Activity name: *Generate task list*
- Activity description: *As the team dives into the app development, need to have a strong list of tasks to perform.*
- Entrance criteria: **
- Exit criteria: *Kanban board created.*
------------------
- Activity name: *Front end research*
- Activity description: *Revise and improve upon the initial UI wireframe.*
- Entrance criteria: *Use existing UI as a reference.*
- Exit criteria: *Create LucidChart for wireframe 2.0.*
