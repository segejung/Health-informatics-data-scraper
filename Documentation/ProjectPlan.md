# Project Plan

**Author**: HZ-TASK Force

## 1 Introduction

Project assigned to HZ-TASK Force is Data Scrapper. 
Many public health entities utiize various formats such as PDFs, Websites, Excel, etc for data handling. This causes a lot of inefficiencies and complexity. The goal of this project is to build a tool that will enable easier data hangling for researchers and develepors. PDF, HTML, Form, and API data will output to CSV.
