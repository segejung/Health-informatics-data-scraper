## 1 User Interface
The user interface consists of multiple interfaces. The main interface is the home page where the users will select from four parsing options.

Each parser will either have an option for the user to upload a file to parse or link an URL.

Once parsing has been completed, it will guide to an interface that will allow users to download as csv.

There will be a download page with a list of job and status.

- PDF function needs to take in PDF file and convert tables into csv.
- HTML function needs to take in URL and convert tables into csv.
- Job page with a list of parsing jobs and job status.
